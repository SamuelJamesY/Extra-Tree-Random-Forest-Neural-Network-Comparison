# Extra-Tree-Random-Forest-Neural-Network-Comparison

Two datasets were used to explore the effectiveness of different models for classification and regression.
The Diabetes dataset was used to compare extra trees, random forests and neural networks for classification,
whilst the energy dataset was used to compare these for regression. 
It was found that both the random forest and extra trees with an ensemble size of 20 performed better
relative to a larger ensemble size of 100. For these datasets the extra tree model performed better,
with a lower RMSE score. The neural network model did not perform as well as the extra tree or 
random forest with a higher RMSE score. For the classification task both the extra tree and neural network models performed the best on 
the diabetes dataset.
